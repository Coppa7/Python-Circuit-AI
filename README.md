# Python-Circuit-AI
Creating a simple artificial intelligence model capable of solving circuits made of linear and bipolar elements using image/text recognition.

This is a learning project since I have almost no actual practical knowledge on AIs, so I thought to start from something not so big. 

Parts of the project:
-Image/text recognition to turn circuits into graphs
-Create algorithm to create circuit problems (finding tensions, currents, resistances etc.) to train AI
-Using a Neural Network (probably) to be trained on all the data created beforehand to then solve circuits

By using training data, the AI will have no actual knowledge on how to solve a circuit but will be based completely on statistical data, making it more useful to solve circuits than to explain them. This would have almost no practical use in real life, since it would be easier to either use algorithms to solve circuits fast, or other AIs to be able to explain them. That's why there will probably be more versions for this AI with more features and hopefully better capabilities, but for now, as already said, its just a learning project.
